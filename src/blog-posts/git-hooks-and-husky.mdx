# Git Hooks and Husky

> Protect your Git repository from mistakes, automate manual processes, gather data about Git activity, and much more with Git hooks.

![git-hooks](/git-hooks.jpg)

Git hooks are shell scripts found in the hidden .git/hooks directory of a Git repository. These scripts trigger actions in response to specific events, so they can help you automate your development lifecycle.

Although you may never have noticed them, every Git repository includes 12 sample scripts.

## Some default scripts:

```shell
# .git/hooks
applypatch-msg.sample
commit-msg.sample
fsmonitor-watchman.sample
post-update.sample
pre-applypatch.sample
pre-commit.sample
pre-merge-commit.sample
prepare-commit-msg.sample
pre-push.sample
pre-rebase.sample
pre-receive.sample
update.sample
```

The sample Git hooks included in your new repo indicate common triggers available to you.

## Write a simple Git hook

### 1. Create a hook file:

-   Create a new file named <span className="hgl">.git/hooks/pre-commit</span>.
-   Open it in a text editor.
-   Add the following code, which queries Git for a list of the files about to be committed for the current branch name and then enters a while loop until it gets a response from the user:

```shell
#!/bin/sh

echo "You are about to commit" $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM)
echo "to" $(git branch --show-current)

while : ; do
    read -p "Do you really want to do this? [y/n] " RESPONSE < /dev/tty
    case "${RESPONSE}" in
        [Yy]* ) exit 0; break;;
        [Nn]* ) exit 1;;
    esac
done
```

### 2. Mark the file executable:

```shell
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### 3. Test it out:

Let's commit any of our file & see what happens.

```shell
git add hello.txt
git commit -m 'superman'

You are about to commit hello.txt to main
Do you really want to do this? [y/n]
```

As you can see it ask us to confirm before actually commiting. If you type y, then it will commit otherwise it won't proceed further.

## Husky

Husky is a tool to use git hooks easily to automatically run scripts on git lifecycle events.

-   This allows us to automate tasks like code linting and testing before committing or pushing changes, creating a safety net for catching potential issues and maintaining consistency.

-   Husky will allow you to automatically run ESLint and Prettier on staged files (files about to be committed).

## Install Husky

```shell
npx husky-init && npm install
```

Once installation completed we will have .husky/pre-commit file in our project's root. Here we can add script that should run before git commit.

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"


npm run lint:fix
```

Update lint:fix script in package.json with below script , this will make sure no warnings allowed in code before commit.

```shell
{
  "scripts":{
#   other scripts...
  "lint:fix": "eslint --fix . --max-warnings=0 prettier --write --ignore-unknown"
  }
}
```

That's it. Now if you git commit your files, it will automatically checks for eslint errors and formatting errors and fixes them before commiting your files.

## Run only on staged files

The above implementation scans all the files everytime we commit. But an ideal setup should be to run the linting scripts only on staged files.

So for that purpose we have <span className="hgl">lint-staged</span> package.

<br />

### Install lint-staged:

Let's install both husky and lint-staged with the below cmd.

```shell
npx mrm@2 lint-staged
```

Then add a configuration to the projectâ€™s package.json that will automatically format supported files in a pre-commit hook.

```shell
"scripts": { ...other scripts },
"lint-staged": {
    "*.{js, jsx, ts, tsx}": [
        "eslint --cache --fix"
    ],
    "*": [
        "prettier --write --ignore-unknown"
    ]
}
```

Finally add npx lint-staged to <span className="hgl">.husky/pre-commit</span> file.

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npx lint-staged
```

Now, on git commit, prettier and eslint scans only the staged files.
