# Setting up React without create-react-app

> We will create a new react project from scratch without using the normal recommended way of using create-react-app. In the process, We will learn and work with Webpack, Babel, and many other different technologies that React uses under the hood.

![react-wo-cra](/react-wo-cra.png)

## Prerequisites

We will be working in a Node environment to install different packages, you will need to have **Node** installed on your machine.

## 1. Create a Node project

This will initialize a new Node project and add the package.json file.

```shell
# terminal
npm init
```

## 2. Create index.html

At the root level, create a folder named public. then create an index.html file inside it.

Now, write an empty div with an id named "root" inside your index.html file's body element.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
    </body>
</html>
```

## 2. Install React dependencies

```shell
npm i react react-dom
```

### React:

The react package contains only the <span className="hgl">functionality</span> necessary to define React components.

**Such as:**

-   Hooks (useEffect, useState, ... etc)
-   Class lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount, ... etc)
-   DOM Attributes (onClick, onChange, onFocus, ... etc )
-   HTML Attributes (className, id, href, disabled, ... etc)
-   JSX

<br />
### React DOM:

This package serves as the entry point to the DOM and server renderers for React. ReactDOM is used to render components and elements on the web, so, ReactDOM library is responsible to actually render UI in the browser.

**Why React team split React and React-DOM into 2 different packages:**

-   React-DOM binds the idea of React to a web browser. React has nothing to do with a browser or web for that matter. That’s why we’re seeing tools and frameworks like React-Native, React-Three being developed. These tools and frameworks don’t use React-DOM, but they do in fact use the idea behind React.
-   As we look at packages like react-native, react-art, react-canvas, and react-three, it's become clear that the beauty and essence of React has nothing to do with browsers or the DOM.
-   To make this more clear and to make it easier to build more environments that React can render to, we’re splitting the main react package into two: react and react-dom.

## 4. Create index.js

At the root level, create a js file name index.js. import React and ReactDOM into the index.js file.

```javascript
//index.js
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
```

Now, lets connect react with the browser DOM using createRoot method provided by react-dom.

```javascript
//index.js
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render();
```

## 5. Create App.js

At the root level, create a folder named src. then inside src create a js file named App.js. This App.js file holds all our app's components.

```javascript
// src/App.js
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
    return <div>App</div>;
};

export default App;
```

Now. lets import the App component & pass it into root.render() method we declared in the index.js file. This will inject our react app into the HTML.

```javascript
//index.js
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './src/App';

const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(<App />);
```

## 6. Install React dependencies

Babel is a toolchain or a JavaScript compiler that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

Here are the main things Babel can do for you::

-   **Compatibility:** React uses contemporary JavaScript syntax, which is incompatible with older browsers. Babel React enables developers to write React code in the most recent syntax, which is subsequently compiled into JavaScript that can be run by older browsers.
-   **JSX Syntax:** React components are written in JSX, which is not supported by older browsers. Babel allows developers to use JSX syntax and compiles it into JavaScript that older browsers can run.
-   **Flexibility:** Babel isn’t just for React JS; it can be used with any JavaScript project. It contains a large ecosystem of plugins that may be used to change certain JavaScript features. Babel allows developers to build more efficient and maintainable code while maintaining browser compatibility.

Let's install the below babel packages as a dev dependencies.

```shell
npm install -D @babel/core babel-loader @babel/cli @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
```

-   **@babel/core:** The core/main package that is needed to use Babel in our project.
-   **babel-loader:** This package will be used to connect Babel and Webpack to use them together.
-   **@babel/cli:** Babel comes with a built-in CLI which can be used to compile files from the command line.
-   **@babel/preset-env:** This is a preset (collection/a set of plugins) of different babel packages that are needed to convert all ES6 JavaScript syntax into older JavaScript versions. Instead of installing them one by one, they are all together in one package.
-   **@babel/preset-react:** This is also preset that contains babel packages needed to convert React JSX syntax into the version of JavaScript supported by older browsers.

## 7. Install Webpack dependencies

At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles.

When building React apps you will end up with many files with different formats and you will need them bundled in a single JavaScript file that will be served with the index.html.

```shell
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
```

-   **webpack:** The actual package that enables us to use webpack in our project.
-   **webpack-cli:** Allows us to run webpack commands in the command line.
-   **webpack-dev-server:** The Webpack server that will act as our local server during the development environment. Under the hood, It provides live reloading. This should be used for development only, it uses <span className="hgl">webpack-dev-middleware</span>, which provides fast in-memory access to the webpack assets.

## 8. Configure Webpack

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
    mode: 'production',
    entry: './index.js',
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: 'index_bundle.js'
    }
};
```

We just created configurations that will be used by Webpack when bundling our react project.

Lets go line by line, code by code:

**1. path:**

-   path is Node.js native utility module.
-   Unlike regular NPM modules, you don't need to install it because it's already inside Node.js

**2. HtmlWebpackPlugin:**

We didn't install HtmlWebpackPlugin yet, so lets install it.

```shell
 npm install --D html-webpack-plugin
```

The <span className="hgl">html-webpack-plugin</span> simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles. We will look into it bit later.

**3. module.exports:**

-   module.exports is the keyword we use to declare all we want to export from that file.
-   Its a commonJS way of exporting things from the file.

**4. mode:**

Webpack provide us 2 modes: development and production.

Providing the mode configuration option tells webpack to use its built-in optimizations accordingly.

**5. entry:**

Specifies the main file (the entry) or the root js file of our application which will be the index.js file we created.

**6. output:**

output key contains a set of options instructing webpack on how and where it should output your bundles, assets, and anything else you bundle or load with webpack.

We are specifying the filename as index.bundle.js and saving it in the dist folder inside the root, here \_\_dirname means our project's root folder & inside that we are telling the webpack to create a folder called dist.

**path.resolve:** The path.resolve() method resolves a sequence of paths or path segments into an absolute path means the resolve method creates proper string representing path to your file.

## 9. Webpack rules

We need to write some rules to tell webpack how it needs to handle different files of our project.

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
    mode: 'production',
    entry: './index.js',
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: 'index_bundle.js'
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/
            }
        ]
    }
};
```

Lets write the rules inside the rules array which is inside the module object.

**1. test:**

-   test is commonly used to match all the files those end with extension that we pass within regular expression.
-   Here we want to match all the files with .js & .jsx.

```shell
test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
```

if we want to include a perticular file or files, then we can use **include**.

```shell
include: [
            path.resolve(__dirname, "app/src"),
            path.resolve(__dirname, "app/test")
          ],
```

**2. exclude:**

If we don’t want webpack to consider some files then we can exclude them using **exclude**.

```javascript
exclude: /node_modules/,
```

## 10. Configure babel

Now is the time to provide the loader for the webpack. In the above explaination we specified the files that webpack has to consider so now lets pass the babel loader into webpack which transpile the files.

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
    mode: 'production',
    entry: './index.js',
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: 'index_bundle.js'
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    loader: 'babel-loader',
                    options: {
                        presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react']
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
};
```

```javascript
use: {
    loader: 'babel-loader';
}
```

now, we need to provide the babel presets (@babel/preset-env and @babel/preset-react) to the babel loader by using options.

```javascript
use: {
    loader: 'babel-loader',
    options: {
        presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react']
    }
}
```

## 11. Connect the optimised bundle with the HTML file.

we can just connect them manually using script tag like below in our index.html file.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="root"></div>

        <!-- HERE -->
        👇
        <script src="index_bundle.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

But what if we use hash to generate our file name dynamically on every new build like below,

```javascript
filename: 'index_[hash].js';
```

So for this purpose we have **html-webpack-plugin** plugin. Usage as below,

```javascript
plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        template: path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html')
    })
];
```

We just need to provide the path of our index.html file to the **new HtmlWebpackPlugin()** method.

<span className="hgl">The final webpack config will look like this 👇</span>

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
    mode: 'production',
    entry: './index.js',
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: 'index_bundle.js'
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    loader: 'babel-loader',
                    options: {
                        presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react']
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    plugins: [
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
            template: path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html')
        })
    ]
};
```

## 12. Add scripts in package.json

For development server, use **webpack serve**.

For production build, use **webpack**

```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack serve",
    "build": "webpack"
  }
```

## 13. Run or Build your application

start a development server.

```shell
npm run dev
```

build an optimised single bundle file.

```shell
npm run build
```
