-   Static Web Applications.
-   Dynamic Web Applications.
-   Single-Page Applications (SPAs)
-   Multi-Page Web Applications (MPAs)
-   Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)

## Static Web Applications

These are the simplest types of web applications built using HTML and CSS.

-   Suitable for creating portfolios or digital brochures.
-   As the name suggests, the content only changes if manually updated by the Developer.
-   Static web applications are straightforward to create and host, as they don’t require extensive server-side processing.
-   This option is a cost-effective solution for individuals or small businesses needing a simple online presence.
-   However, their simplicity also means limited functionality.

## Dynamic Web Applications

In contrast, dynamic web applications are more complex and interactive.

-   They use client-side and server-side scripts (like JavaScript, PHP, ASP, or JSP) to generate content in real-time.
-   These web application categories are connected to a database, allowing them to provide personalized experiences based on user interactions and preferences.
-   They’re ideal for businesses, especially if your top priorities are user engagement and content variability.
-   Dynamic web applications are more sophisticated than static web applications and have several elements of interaction and methods to draw attention to products or services.

## Single-Page Applications (SPAs)

SPAs load a single HTML page and dynamically update content as users interact with the app.

-   The benefit is that this web app type avoids reloading the entire page with each user action, leading to a smoother and faster user experience.
-   However, they also come with challenges, particularly in SEO optimization and initial load times, as the entire application must be loaded simultaneously.
-   SPAs are built using JavaScript frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.js, which handle the dynamic loading of content and user interface elements.
-   After the first request to the server, all the necessary local data is stored in the server, and that provides the user with the ability to work offline too. For example, Google Docs offline mode.

These categories of web applications are ideal for platforms where user experience and speed are critical, such as:

-   Social media platforms
-   Email clients
-   Cloud-based software

## Multi-Page Web Applications (MPAs)

Unlike SPAs, MPAs reload the entire page from the server when the user interacts with the application.

-   MPAs look and function like traditional websites, where you navigate through multiple separate pages, and each page is devoted to a specific product, service, or piece of content.
-   They’re also better optimized for search engines, as each page can be indexed separately.
-   MPA results in slower page transitions and perceived delays as it requires the complete page to reload every time.
-   MPAs can be slower than SPAs because they have to load a new page for each action.
-   MPA pages are easily navigable and searchable by search engine crawlers because they are made up of multiple static pages.
-   In order to load the pages browser needs the server to be accessed every time hence, MPA provides limited offline capabilities, and nearly all MPA needs an internet connection to run.

MPAs are common in content-heavy websites, such as news sites and e-commerce sites. Some examples of MPAs include:

-   Amazon
-   Wikipedia
-   Blogs etc.
-   eBay and Amazon are the best examples of MPAs. These websites transfer a lot of data from server to client and client to server, hence they are low on speed.

## Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)

PWAs represent a hybrid of regular web pages (or websites) and a mobile application.

-   They’re installable on a device’s home screen without downloading from an app store.
-   PWAs are also responsive and linkable, which can be shared via a URL.
-   Developers use standard web technologies to build them, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

A key feature of PWAs is the use of service workers or scripts running in the background, enabling:

-   Offline functionality
-   Push notifications
-   Background data syncing
